**Note:** The script now automatically installs any missing dependencies, so you don't need to worry about manually installing them!

## System Architecture

Before installation, check your system architecture:

```bash
uname -m
```

This will show one of:
- `x86_64` - For 64-bit Intel/AMD systems
- `aarch64` or `arm64` - For ARM64 systems (like Android devices, Raspberry Pi)

## Installation

### Download Links

The script now automatically fetches the latest version from the GitHub repository, so you always get the most up-to-date version of Cursor AI Editor.

### From GitHub Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MaheshTechnicals/cursor-free-vip-termux.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd cursor-free-vip-termux

# Make the script executable
chmod +x cursor.sh

# Run the installer (it will automatically detect your architecture)
sudo ./cursor.sh
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
sudo bash cursor.sh
```

### Command-line Options

```bash
# Install Cursor AI Editor
sudo bash cursor.sh -i

# Uninstall Cursor AI Editor
sudo bash cursor.sh -u

# Update to the latest version
sudo bash cursor.sh -p

# Reset request IDs
bash cursor.sh -r

# Show information about Cursor
bash cursor.sh -a

# Display help
bash cursor.sh -h
```

## Automatic Dependency Management

The script now includes an intelligent dependency management system that:

1. Automatically detects missing required dependencies
2. Identifies your system's package manager (apt, dnf, yum, pacman, or zypper)
3. Installs the missing dependencies using the appropriate package manager
4. Verifies that the installation was successful
5. Optionally installs recommended dependencies for enhanced functionality

This eliminates the need to manually install dependencies before running the script.

## Using on Android with Termux

This tool can be used on Android devices through Termux by installing a Linux distribution:

### Recommended Distros for Android

1. **Ubuntu 24.04 (Recommended)**
   - Follow the installation guide: [How to Install Ubuntu 24.04 on Android Without Root](https://maheshtechnicals.com/how-to-install-ubuntu-24-04-on-android-without-root/)

2. **Kali Linux**
   - Alternative option: [How to Install Kali Linux on Android (No Root) 2024](https://maheshtechnicals.com/how-to-install-kali-linux-on-android-no-root-2024/)

After installing your preferred Linux distro in Termux, you can proceed with the Cursor AI Editor installation as described above.

## Privacy

This script provides functionality to reset the telemetry IDs that Cursor uses, giving you a fresh identity when needed. It creates backups of your original configuration for safety.

## Customization

The installer creates configuration at `$HOME/.config/Cursor/` which is specific to your user account. All backup paths and configurations are dynamically set based on the current user's home directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter permission issues:
- For installation/uninstallation: Run the script with `sudo`
- For configuration changes: Ensure you have write permissions to your config directory

If automatic dependency installation fails:
- The script will inform you which dependencies could not be installed
- You can install them manually using your system's package manager
- Try running the script again after installing the missing dependencies
